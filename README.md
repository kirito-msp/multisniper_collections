# multisniper_collections
A collection of tools created by @x3raphim the developer of MultiSniper

This repository hosts part of my work in crypto along the years. As we started our jurney in 2021 with the first Sniper MultiSniper Basic and then advanced to MultiSniper Plus, i have since then created multiple analytic tools and bots.

Hope this helps some of you that search to create your own tools to help you grow your contribution to crypto space and ofc make some money.

My plan/goal:
I will start on a new project that i will dedicate my whole time to it and will try my best to get my life back together (you that have been close to me past all these years, know what im refering to).
Sadly i can't keep the tools running for free since servers cost money, but i will provide here most of things that i consider being usefull and hope anyone that wants to use them will improve more on them and try to provide a free service to give back to the community as i tried past all these years.

From the list of tools you have:
- Mongo Db Setup and install (most analytic tools work with mongodb)
- Multi Chain Api & Scanner (Bsc,Eth,Base,Avax...) - A system that is designed to process every block on multiple chains and record new contracts creations, launches and trading events to store a complete history. You also have endpoints to provide api's to your friends or even use them in your own tools.
- Telegram Scraper - A simple message scraping using your own telegram account or other alt tg account that is in the targeted group to scrape contracts, i used it to monitor influencer calls of new tokens to store them in the Multi Chain Database.
- Tg Routing Message Balancer - A system that is designed to act as a intermediary so you can send multiple messages to telegram and each time it can use a different bot to send that messsage, avoiding telegram limits.
- Wallet Tracker & Reminder (Telegram Group & Private bot) (Bsc,Eth,Base,Avax)- A full source code of a working telegram bot that can be used in groups or in dm to monitor wallets on multiple chain (buys/sells), set reminders (one time, recurent), monitor wallets for new token creations, all this with admin info and timezone for each user.
- Meta Score Board (Bsc,Eth,Base,Avax) - a bot that uses the MultiChain database and a filter to score trading tokens (ex: https://t.me/multisniperbots/305865).
- Solana Pump Fun Alerts (Solana)- 2 part system, 1 api that will store in the database all the new tokens launched on solana and 2 the telegram bot that connects to the database api to post new alerts.
- MultiSniper Pro (Bsc,Eth,Base,Arbitrum,Polygon,Avax) - MultiSniper Full Source code with laravel interface & login.
- Zora Deploys & Info Scraper (Base)- 3 part system, 1 blockchain scanner with information storring in the database, 2 zora api interogation with auth bearer for info like twitter followers and handle, 3 zora script with puppeteer to update the auth bearer.
- Four Meme Deploy & Monitoring (Bsc)- Scripts to scan and store new launches + monitor for graduation and market cap.
- Boop Fun Alerts (Base) - Scripts to scan and post in telegram new tokens that are about to graduate + system to scan every new launch.
- Arena Trade - Scan and store in the database + post in telegram new launches, has also included trades tracker with alert and snipe for when a new token is launched or graduates.
- Utilities:
  *  Node testing script (WS + RPC)
